#### Full-stack developer | Embedded Software Engineer at PK Mech Power Formula Student Racing Team
I’m an Applied Computer Science student and an active member of the Formula Student Racing Team. My passion for software engineering started in high school and has grown through building full-stack web and mobile applications, as well as exploring embedded systems.

### Experience

#### Full-stack Web Development

|---|---|
| **Altus** is a fully functional full-stack dashboard and a flagship project of mine that embodies my long-standing vision of a clean and intuitive web application. Delivered as an MVP in late 2024, it continued to evolve alongside my academic and personal projects. It features a session-based authentication, RBAC, user profile management, references external APIs like Open Charge Map to find EV chargers near you and handles all the logic for separate users registered in the app. | <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db9bb2b-3530-447e-b4d0-ef90525d0579" />  |

Built in three weeks using only an Atari emulator and gameplay footage as references, it features a custom platformer engine with collision detection, ladders, and waterfall physics, along with simple but effective enemy logic. The engine is optimized for HTML canvas to ensure smooth sprite performance, translating retro gameplay mechanics into a modern web experience. |

| Since 2024, I'm an active PK Mech Power Formula Student Racing Team member responsible for software development for STM32 MCUs used across the Formula Student car, covering architecture design, CAN communication, pedal calibration, telemetry, control systems and powertrain support. I've also maintained and updated software throughout Formula Student Alpe Adria 2025 and Formula Student Poland 2025 interrnational competitions, ensuring compliance with competition regulations. | <img width="964" height="1285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b695efe5-2ae3-4b73-98f6-dbbedcf89e42" />
