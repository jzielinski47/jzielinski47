#### Full-stack developer | Embedded Software Engineer at PK Mech Power Formula Student Racing Team
I’m an Applied Computer Science student and an active member of the Formula Student Racing Team. My passion for software engineering started in high school and has grown through building full-stack web and mobile applications, as well as exploring embedded systems.

### Experience

#### Full-stack Web Development

|---|---|
| Altus Dashboard is a full-stack web application showcasing modern design and robust backend features. Originally conceived during my time working at Krakow International Airport, it reflects my long-term vision of creating a clean and intuitive dashboard application. Delivered as an MVP in late 2024, it continues to evolve alongside my academic and personal projects.<br/><br/>**Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS (TypeScript),<br/> **Backend**: Node JS, Express JS, Passport JS (TypeScript),<br/> **Database**: MongoDB,<br/> **Other features**: Session-based authentication with RBAC,<br/> **Referenced external APIs**: Open Charge Map  | <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db9bb2b-3530-447e-b4d0-ef90525d0579" />  |

Fortier for the Atari 8-bit family and published in 1984 by Datasoft. My task was to port the game to the browser, writing it from scratch in TypeScript and so I did. I wrote the entire platformer game engine and the game from scratch as my high school project. It took me an entire three weeks to develop and polish it, as I only had the Atari emulator and the video on YouTube showcasing the game. I am really content with the final result, especially with the simple logic for the enemy I came up with.  |
