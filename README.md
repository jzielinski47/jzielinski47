| Altus Dashboard is a full-stack web application showcasing modern design and robust backend features. Originally conceived during my time working at Krakow International Airport, it reflects my long-term vision of creating a clean and intuitive dashboard application. Delivered as an MVP in late 2024, it continues to evolve alongside my academic and personal projects.<br/><br/>**Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS (TypeScript),<br/> **Backend**: Node JS, Express JS, Passport JS (TypeScript),<br/> **Database**: MongoDB,<br/> **Other features**: Session-based authentication with RBAC,<br/> **Referenced external APIs**: Open Charge Map  | <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db9bb2b-3530-447e-b4d0-ef90525d0579" />  |

Fortier for the Atari 8-bit family and published in 1984 by Datasoft. My task was to port the game to the browser, writing it from scratch in TypeScript and so I did. I wrote the entire platformer game engine and the game from scratch as my high school project. It took me an entire three weeks to develop and polish it, as I only had the Atari emulator and the video on YouTube showcasing the game. I am really content with the final result, especially with the simple AI for the enemy I came up with.  |

Aiming to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and apply to the rules and the principles of web brutalism. However, the key difference are the animations which are an exception to the general rules as they make the website more appeeling to the viewer. | <img width="2257" height="1267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fcf12b7-ccec-4124-82e1-1ebe6164da42" /> |
