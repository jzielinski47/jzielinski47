| Altus is a fully functional dashboard that embodies my long-standing vision of a clean and intuitive web application. For several years, I aspired to create such a project but lacked the time while working as a barista at Krakow International Airport. By the last quarter of 2024, I successfully delivered it in its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) state. The app steadily progressed as I developed it alongside my primary university tasks, working on it in my spare time, driven by a passion to create something unique and truly my own in a field I was deeply passionate about | <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db9bb2b-3530-447e-b4d0-ef90525d0579" />  |

Fortier for the Atari 8-bit family and published in 1984 by Datasoft. My task was to port the game to the browser, writing it from scratch in TypeScript and so I did. I wrote the entire platformer game engine and the game from scratch as my high school project. It took me an entire three weeks to develop and polish it, as I only had the Atari emulator and the video on YouTube showcasing the game. I am really content with the final result, especially with the simple AI for the enemy I came up with.  |

Aiming to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and apply to the rules and the principles of web brutalism. However, the key difference are the animations which are an exception to the general rules as they make the website more appeeling to the viewer. | <img width="2257" height="1267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fcf12b7-ccec-4124-82e1-1ebe6164da42" /> |
